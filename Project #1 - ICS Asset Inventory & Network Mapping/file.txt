Goal: Fingerprint ICS/SCADA assets, analyze traffic, and produce a Purdue model network map.
Outcome: network diagram + summary report

Step 0: Preparation
i) Download free ICS PCAP datasets:
   - https://github.com/tjcruz-dei/ICS_PCAPS/releases/tag/MODBUSTCP%231 (Modbus/TCP)
ii) Install tools:
   - Wireshark – network traffic analysis  
   - Draw.io – Purdue model network diagram  
   - Notepad/Word – notes & summary

Step 1: Load ICS traffic
i) Open Wireshark 
ii) Load sample PCAP files (Modbus/TCP traffic)  
iii) Filter traffic by protocol:
   - Modbus: `modbus`  
   - TCP: `tcp`  
iv) Note IP addresses, device types, ports for each device
   - Example: 192.168.1.10 → PLC  
   - 192.168.1.20 → HMI  
   - 192.168.1.30 → Historian
   
Step 2: Identify Assets
i) Create a table with the following columns:
   | Device Name | IP Address | Protocol | Device Type | Function | Notes |
ii) From traffic analysis, populate each row with observed devices:
   - PLC, HMI, RTU, Engineering Workstation, Historian
iii) Optional: Highlight any unusual traffic or unknown devices(for anomaly detection later)

Step 3: Map ICS Network
i) Open Draw.io → blank canvas  
ii) Use Purdue Model zones:
   - Level 0–1: Field devices (sensors, actuators)  
   - Level 2: Control devices (PLC, RTU)  
   - Level 3: Supervisory (HMI, SCADA)  
   - Level 4: Enterprise / Historian / Engineering Workstations  
iii) Place assets in correct zones, connect with network links  
iv) Label protocols (Modbus, DNP3) and IP addresses  
v) Highlight any **critical network paths** (remote access, control links)

Step 4: Summary Report
i) Create a 1-page report named as: 'Project_#1_ICS_Asset_Inventory_Report.pdf' containing:
   - Brief introduction (purpose of asset inventory & mapping)  
   - Table of assets (from Step 2)  
   - Network diagram (from Step 3, export PNG/PDF)  
   - Observations:
     - Insecure function codes (Modbus FC06/FC05)  
     - Any unknown or suspicious devices  
     - Potential segmentation improvements
